# Risk Register (Week 06)

### 1. Risk Table
| Risk ID | Description | Category | Likelihood (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Score (L x I) | Response |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R1** | **Computer is too slow:** Training the AI model takes too long on a regular laptop, causing delays. | Resource | 4 | 4 | **16** | **Avoid:** Use Google Colab/Cloud GPUs. |
| **R2** | **Not enough face photos:** We might not find 10,000 quality images or they lack variety. | Technical | 3 | 5 | **15** | **Mitigate:** Use data augmentation (flip/rotate). |
| **R3** | **Video lag:** The AI takes too long (>500ms) to process video frames. | Technical | 3 | 4 | **12** | **Mitigate:** Resize images to lower resolution. |
| **R4** | **Coding errors:** Debugging Python errors takes longer than planned. | Schedule | 3 | 3 | **9** | **Accept:** Prioritize core features first. |
| **R5** | **Team availability:** A member gets sick or is busy with other assignments. | Stakeholder | 2 | 4 | **8** | **Transfer:** Reassign tasks immediately. |

### 2. Top Priority Risks (Mitigation Plans)
*Based on the highest scores above:*

**1. R1 – Computer is too slow (Score: 16)**
- **Mitigation:** Switch from local laptop training to Google Colab (Free Tier) or Kaggle Kernels to utilize cloud GPUs.
- **Owner:** [Insert Name of Developer]
- **Tentative Date:** Week 07

**2. R2 – Not enough face photos (Score: 15)**
- **Mitigation:** If we cannot find 10,000 images, we will apply data augmentation (random rotations, lighting changes, flipping) to multiply our existing dataset.
- **Owner:** [Insert Name of Data Lead]
- **Tentative Date:** Week 06

**3. R3 – Video lag (Score: 12)**
- **Mitigation:** Implement a frame-skipping algorithm (process every 3rd frame) or reduce input resolution (e.g., to 640x480) to improve speed.
- **Owner:** [Insert Name of System Architect]
- **Tentative Date:** Week 09 (Testing Phase)

## Integration Notes
- Quality checks added after Task 2.2 (Model Training).
- High-risk tasks identified in Phase 2 and 3.
- Schedule updated on Planner to reflect additional review cycles.
