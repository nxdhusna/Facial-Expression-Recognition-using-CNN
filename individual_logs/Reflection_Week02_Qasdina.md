What did I contribute this week? 
I wrote the "Proposed Approach," "Expected Outcome," and "Evaluation Metrics" sections of our concept document.

What did I learn about collaboration or planning? 
I learned how to select the right metrics. For our classification project, it was important to list Accuracy, Precision, and F1-Score so we have a clear way to measure our success.

What challenges did I face? 
My main challenge was writing the "Proposed Approach" simply. It was hard to explain the different tools we need, like TensorFlow and OpenCV, without making it sound too complicated.

What will I focus on next week? 
I will set up our first Jupyter Notebook in the /notebooks/ folder and install the libraries we need.
