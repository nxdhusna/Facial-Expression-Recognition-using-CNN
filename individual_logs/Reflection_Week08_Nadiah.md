# Individual Lessons Learned - Week 08
**Name:** Nadiah
**Role:** Evaluation & Testing

## Reflection

### 1. What planning activity helped most in monitoring progress?
The **Quality Checklist (Week 06)** helped me the most. Even though the training is delayed, having the specific target of **85% accuracy** and **<500ms inference time** allowed me to set up my evaluation scripts (WBS 5.2.1) in advance. This means that as soon as Angelo finishes the cloud training, I can run my tests immediately without wasting more time.

### 2. What would you do differently in future projects?
I would advocate for **Parallel Tasking**. I spent too much time waiting for the model to finish training before starting the evaluation documentation. In future projects, I would create "dummy data" to test my evaluation and visualization scripts during Week 07, so the entire testing pipeline is verified and ready before the real model is even finished.
