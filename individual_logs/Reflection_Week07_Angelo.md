# Week 07 Reflection - Angelo

## 1. How does effective communication reduce project risks?
Effective communication acts as an early warning system for risks. In our "SKIPZ" project, we identified "Data Privacy" as a key risk. By explicitly listing "Data Subjects" as stakeholders in our communication plan, we ensure that ethical considerations aren't forgotten during development. Furthermore, regular updates to the University Lab Admin ensure we don't face unexpected infrastructure blocks (like network bans) that could delay our model training. Clear communication ensures everyone knows *who* is responsible for *what*, preventing tasks from being dropped.

## 2. Which stakeholder is most critical to your project’s success and why?
The most critical stakeholder is our supervisor, **Dr. Farhan Khan**.
* **Reason:** According to our Power/Interest analysis, he holds **High Power** and **High Interest**. While the "End Users" determine if the product is useful, Dr. Farhan determines if the project meets the academic criteria for passing.
* **Impact:** If we fail to communicate our progress to him (e.g., missing the Week 07 milestone), we could fail the course even if the code works perfectly. Therefore, our Communication Plan prioritizes "Weekly Progress Updates" specifically for him to ensure alignment with his expectations.
