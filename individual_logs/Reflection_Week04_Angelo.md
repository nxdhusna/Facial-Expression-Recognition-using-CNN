Which phase had the most subtasks?
Based on the WBS, 2.0 Data Collection and 4.0 Model Training had the most work packages assigned to the team. For me specifically, 4.0 Model Training was highly detailed due to the focus on parameters and checkpoints, which is critical for model success.

How did WBS help plan better?
Decomposing the tasks was crucial for clarifying ownership and managing technical risk. Specifically, assigning tasks like 3.1.2 Define layer structure and 5.2.1 Calculate performance metrics to myself ensured that key design decisions and evaluation metrics align directly with the project's ≥75% accuracy goal. It turns abstract work into measurable actions.

What would you adjust next week?
I would adjust the schedule to incorporate time for Integration Test Planning (R5 risk mitigation) earlier in the Model Design phase (3.0). We need a dedicated check-in point before full training begins to verify that Angelo's Model Design output (3.1.2) is ready for Qasdina's front-end integration (6.3.1) to prevent a schedule delay.
