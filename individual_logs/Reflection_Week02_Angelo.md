What did I contribute this week? 
I designed the project workflow diagram that shows our full process. I also set up our team's GitHub repository folders.

What did I learn about collaboration or planning? 
I learned that making a flowchart first is really helpful. It helped the whole team agree on the steps for training our model and how the final app will work.

What challenges did I face? 
The main challenge was just making the diagram look clean. I wanted to clearly show the two different parts—the "training" part and the "live camera" part—without it being confusing.

What will I focus on next week? 
I'm going to start looking for the facial expression datasets we planned to use.
