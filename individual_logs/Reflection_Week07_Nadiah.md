1. How does effective communication help mitigate project risks?
Effective communication helps identify issues early and keeps the team aligned. In "SKIPZ," regular updates and open channels with stakeholders like the university helped us spot data and technical challenges quickly, reducing delays and misunderstandings.

2. Who is the most vital stakeholder for your project's success, and why?
The client's ethics review board is the most critical stakeholder because their approval is necessary for data collection. Securing their support ensures we meet ethical standards and can proceed without legal or compliance issues.
