Reflection 

● What was the most challenging part of building the schedule? 
- Synchronizing Team Availability 
- Coordinating between academic deadlines, personal commitments, and project tasks  was complex. We had to adjust timelines multiple times to ensure everyone could  contribute consistently.  

● How did GitHub and Teams support your collaboration? 
- Version Control & Task Tracking (GitHub) 
- GitHub helped manage code changes, track issues, and assign tasks through 
branches, commits, and pull requests—keeping everyone aligned and avoiding 
conflicts  

● What tasks will you refine next week? 
- Breaking down tasks into realistic, trackable milestones.
