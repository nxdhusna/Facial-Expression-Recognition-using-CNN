# Reflection Week 06

# 1. Which quality criterion do you think will be hardest to achieve?
The **User Interface (Usability)** requirements. While the backend logic might work, displaying the bounding box and the emotion text smoothly on top of the video feed can be tricky. If the UI flickers or the text is hard to read, the user experience will be poor, even if the math behind it is correct.

# 2. Which risk poses the greatest threat to your project and why?
**R4 (Coding Errors/Schedule Delays)**. We have a tight deadline. If we spend too much time fixing bugs in the integration phase (connecting the model to the camera feed), we might run out of time for testing. Technical delays are the most likely reason we would miss our submission deadline.

# 3. How does quality management support project success?
It helps in risk mitigation. By identifying risks now (like the computer speed or lack of data), we have created plans to fix them (like using Google Colab). This proactive approach means we won't panic if things go wrong later, because we already have a "Plan B" ready in our Risk Register.
