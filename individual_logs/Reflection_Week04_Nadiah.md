Which phase had the most subtasks?
4.0 Model Training was definitely the most time-consuming and sub-task heavy, especially with 4.3.1 Full Training & Optimization taking 3 days. Also, 7.0 Testing & Validation has a lot of necessary detail for documentation (7.4.1), which is my responsibility.

How did WBS help plan better?
The WBS made it possible to clearly separate logistics from development. My responsibility for 3.2.1 Set up the ML environment and 3.2.2 Secure compute resources is a clear dependency for Qasdina and Angelo. The WBS clearly showed that if my tasks slip, the entire 4.0 Training phase cannot start. This enforces strong organizational focus.

What would you adjust next week?
I would add a half-day buffer to 4.3.1 Train the model on the full augmented dataset because GPU capacity and training stability are high risks (R3). The current 3-day duration is tight, so a small contingency period would make the schedule more realistic against the hardware failure risk.
