What did I contribute this week? 
I wrote the "Problem Statement" and the "Objectives" for our project concept.

What did I learn about collaboration or planning? 
I learned that setting clear objectives is key. By deciding on "75% accuracy" and a "10,000 image dataset" early, our whole team now knows exactly what our target is.

What challenges did I face? 
The hardest part was setting a realistic accuracy goal. I had to do some quick research to see what other CNN projects have achieved so we picked a number that was challenging but possible.

What will I focus on next week? 
I'll start gathering the image files for our dataset and put them in the /data/ folder.
