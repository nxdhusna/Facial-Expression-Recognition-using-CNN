# Individual Lessons Learned - Week 08
**Name:** Qasdina
**Role:** Data Engineer

## Reflection

### 1. What planning activity helped most in monitoring progress?
The **WBS (Work Breakdown Structure)** was very helpful for my role. By breaking down the data phase into specific tasks like "Filtering" (2.3.1) and "Augmentation" (2.4.1), I was able to complete my deliverables on time. This provided a "clean hand-off" to the training phase, making it easy for the team to identify that the current delay is a hardware issue (Resource) and not a data quality issue.

### 2. What would you do differently in future projects?
I would be more mindful of the **Computational Cost of Data**. I successfully increased the dataset to 10,000 images via augmentation (WBS 2.4.1), but I didn't fully communicate to the Project Lead how much this would slow down the training process. In the future, I would provide a "Data Impact Report" that estimates how much training time will increase based on the final dataset size.
