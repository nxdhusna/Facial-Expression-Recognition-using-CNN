Which phase had the most subtasks?
2.0 Data Collection had the most individual work packages (5 in total). While 4.0 Model Training takes longer, the sheer number of detailed steps like 2.3.1 Filter low-quality images and 2.5.1 Finalize and version control made data work the most fragmented and detail-oriented phase.

How did WBS help plan better?
The WBS was essential for resource allocation, especially in the testing phases. It confirmed that the Data Cleaning tasks (2.3.1) are my priority, and the downstream testing tasks like 7.3.1 Conduct UAT are also mine. This clear ownership minimizes confusion over who is responsible for data quality versus model quality.

What would you adjust next week?
I would allocate an extra day to 2.3.1 Filter out low-quality/unlabeled images. Since Data Skew (R1) is our highest risk (Score 9), the quality of the cleaned data is non-negotiable. Adding time here will reduce the downstream risk of the model failing to meet accuracy goals in phase 5.0.
