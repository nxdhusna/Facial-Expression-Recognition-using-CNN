# Individual Lessons Learned - Week 08
**Name:** Angelo
**Role:** Project Lead

## Reflection

### 1. What planning activity helped most in monitoring progress?
The **Risk Register (Week 06)** was the most valuable tool this week. We had identified **Risk R1 (Computer is too slow)** as a high-priority threat with a score of 16. Because we had a pre-planned response (moving to Google Colab), I was able to make a quick executive decision to reallocate resources the moment I saw Task 4.3.1 falling behind schedule. This prevented a minor delay from becoming a project-ending bottleneck.

### 2. What would you do differently in future projects?
I would implement a **Resource Buffer**. While the WBS was accurate for a standard workflow, AI training is unpredictable. In the future, I would add a 20% "contingency time" specifically for the Model Training phase to account for hardware limitations or model convergence issues, ensuring we stay on the "On Track" status even if training takes an extra day.
