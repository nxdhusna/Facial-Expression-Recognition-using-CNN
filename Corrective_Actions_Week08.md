# Week 08 - Corrective Actions

Based on the performance analysis showing delays in the Model Training phase (WBS 4.3.1), the following corrective actions are being implemented:

## 1. Resource Reallocation (Response to Risk R1)
- **Proposed Action:** Move the training environment from local hardware to **Google Colab Pro** to utilize high-performance cloud GPUs.
- **Responsibility:** Angelo
- **Deadline:** Immediate

## 2. Schedule Adjustment
- **Proposed Action:** To recover the lost 2 days, the team will postpone the "Dashboard UI/UX refinement" (WBS 6.1.1) and focus exclusively on finishing the model training and evaluation metrics over the next 48 hours.
- **Responsibility:** Nadiah & Qasdina
- **Deadline:** End of Week 09

## 3. Scope Refinement (Optional Mitigation)
- **Proposed Action:** If cloud training still lags, we will reduce the number of training epochs from 100 to 50, provided the validation accuracy remains above our quality target of 75%.
- **Responsibility:** Angelo
